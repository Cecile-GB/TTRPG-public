## Features & Traits
### Class Features
**Favored Enemy** : Humanoids
You have advantage on Survival checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on INT checks to recall information about them. You also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

Humanoids are the main peoples of the world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species.
-  Dwarves
-  Humans

**Natural Explorer** : Swamp
You have a favored terrain type. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for proficient skills when you make an INT or WIS check related to it. While traveling for an hour or more in your chosen terrain, difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel, your group can’t become lost except by magical means, you remain alert to danger even when you are engaged in another activity, you can move stealthily at a normal pace (while alone), you find twice as much food while foraging, and while tracking creatures, you learn the exact number, sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions.

**Fighting Style** : Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

**Ranger Archetype** : Hunter

**Primeval Awareness**
As an action, you can expend one ranger spell slot (1 minute per level of spell slot) to sense whether any aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain). This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.

**Hunter’s Prey** : Colossus Slayer
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its HP maximum.
### Racial Traits
**Speed** :: 30 ft (swimming speed equal to walking speed)

**Bite** 
You have a fanged maw that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals **1d6**+ your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

**Hold Breath**
You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

**Hungry Jaws**
You can throw yourself into a feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your Bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Natural Armor**
You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your base AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
### Feats
**Observant**
Quick to notice details of your environment, you gain the following benefits:
-  Increase your Intelligence or **Wisdom** score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
-  If you can see a creature's mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it's saying by reading its lips.
-  You have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.
